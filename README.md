I'm excited to share my first data analytic project built on Excel.

•	This interactive dashboard analysis was built entirely on Excel, using Student Performance Data to extract insight on the student performance, factors affecting the student performance with key metrics related to study habits, family background, school attendance, and overall performance. Key insights include;

  i.	More study time on GPA

  ii.	Parental support on GPA

  iii.	Absence significance on GPA

  iv.	Students with tutoring performing better

  v.	Participation in extracurricular activity on academic performance

Tools used; Microsoft Excel/ Pivot Table/ Pivot Chart

This project helped my skills in storytelling, dashboard design and insight generation

I'm open to feedbacks and collaboration.
